the Exception of Leap Year too.
The program is built by considering 1800 as a base year, hence user inputs must be greater than 1800.

3] Clock

This is an analog clock which shows the current time and runs alive.
The program on execution takes current System time and then self sustains using timely programmed delays.
The hands of clock are animated by using 2-Dimensional Transformations of a Line which is fixed by one end at Center.
Rotate function performs the transformations.
